# sign_language_project
This project aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating sign language into spoken English. Utilizing an AI-powered camera and a Raspberry Pi, this system captures sign language gestures, converts them into text, and then transforms the text into speech.
